        <h3>A korean dish of rich with cooked vegetables, usually meat, and often a raw or fried egg.</h3>
        <p>Preparing the classic Korean dish bibimbap at home takes some time and planning, but it's well worth it, whether you're throwing <i>a dinner party</i> or just happen to love <i>meal prepping</i>. And while there is no definitive bibimbap recipe; versions made with <i>steak, eggs, and brocolli rabe, a mix of spring vegetables,</i> and more abound: the one constant is rice topped with an array of garnishes. Think lightly cured or cooked vegetables and proteins that play off of and balance once another, a helping of gochujangg (Korean pepper paste), and sometimes a raw egg yolk or sunny-side up egg to help bring it together once you start mixing.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, bibimbap is made with cooked rice that's been cooled and then crisped in a pan. The crispy rice may be cooked in and served from a hot stone bowl called a <i>dolsot</i>, but a <i>cast-iron</i> or other <i>nonstick pan</i> (and that <i>ceramic serveware</i> you just bought) will do fine.</p>
