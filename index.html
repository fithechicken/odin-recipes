        <h3>A korean dish of rich with cooked vegetables, usually meat, and often a raw or fried egg.</h3>
        <p>Preparing the classic Korean dish bibimbap at home takes some time and planning, but it's well worth it, whether you're throwing a dinner party or just happen to love meal prepping. And while there is no definitive bibimbap recipe; versions made with steak, eggs, and brocolli rabe, a mix of spring vegetables, and more abound: the one constant is rice topped with an array of garnishes. Think lightly cured or cooked vegetables and proteins that play off of and balance once another, a helping of gochujangg (Korean pepper paste), and sometimes a raw egg yolk or sunny-side up egg to help bring it together once you start mixing.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, bibimbap is made with cooked rice that's been cooled and then crisped in a pan. The crispy rice may be cooked in and served from a hot stone bowl called a <i>dolsot</i>, but a <i>cast-iron</i> or other <i>nonstick pan</i> (and that <i>ceramic serveware</i> you just bought) will do fine.</p>
        <p>For this bibimbap recipe you'll marinate <i>thinly sliced beef</i> in soy and grated Asian pear (the latter of which sweetens and tenderizes the meat) to make <i>bulgogi</i>. Use the marinating time to prepare the rice bowl's optional accompanisments, like <i>bean sprouts</i> with sesame seeds, julienned <i>sesame seeds</i>, <i>garlicky spinach</i>, <i>sou-glazed shiitake mushrooms</i>, <i>sauteed zucchini</i>, <i>scallion claw</i>, <i>wakame</i>, and a <i>bibimbap sauce</i> with gochujang and dates. If you're short on time, these can be made in advance, and most can be found already prepared at a Korean supermarket.</p>
