        <img src="images/takoyaki.jpg" alt="Takoyaki Image">
        <h3>Common known in English as Japanese octopus balls - is a quintessential Japanese street food that's found especially at summer festivals in Japan.</h3>
        <p>Takoyaki is a Japanese term for "octopus grilled/fried," and they are a very popular yatai(or mobile street food) snack. These lightly fried octopus balls have a crisp outer shell with a soft and moist center filled with pieces of octopus, pickled ginger, green onions, and crunchy tenkasu(or tempura pieces).</p>
        <p>These fried ocotpus balls were first popularized by a man named <i>Tomekichi Endo</i> from Osaka, Japan in the 1930's. Originally, they were filled with beef and konjac, they are far better known for their octopus filling these days. Endo was influenced by a Japanese dumpling called akashiyaki, which was made of egg batter and octopus.</p>

        <h2>STEPS</h2>
        <h3>Preperation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the ocotpus into roughly 1/2 inch cube size.</li>
            <li>Chop the spring onion into small pieces.</li>
            <li>Chop the red pickled ginger into small pieces.</li>
            <li>Beat the egg in a large mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Add water and Tsuyu-no-Moto to your large bowl and mix well.</li>
            <li>Add flour and dashi powder into the bowl and mix well until no dried (clumped) flour remains.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the takoyaki grill pan on the stove on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Place a small amount of oil in the individual holes with the oiling brush and also coat the other surfaces of the pan with some oil as well.</li>
            <li>When the pan is heated, pour the batter into each hole about halfway full (we will add more later).</li>
            <li>Place a piece of octopus into each hole.</li>
            <li>Add some tempura flakes, spring onion, and red pickled ginger into each hole.</li>
            <li>Fill up each hole with the batter and let it overflow out of the hole. Be sure not to pour too much, that it overflows the pan. The goal is to cover the entire top portion of the pan without overflowing onto the counter/grill top.</li>
            <li>Flip the Takoyaki balls:
                <p>Once the batter outside the holes start to look like it's not liquid anymore, it's time to flip those half balls over within the hole. This is where the skill comes into play.</p>
                <p>To do this you will be testing your chopstick skills. Use one of the chopsticks to hook the outside cooked part of the half ball on the opposite side from you. Hook from the inside of the ball angle and try to flip it by dragging the point in the direction towards you. For example: in a circular motion, swipe the ball around to flip it over.</p>
                <p>Then, use your chopsticks to push some of the half cooked batter around the hole on the surface of the pan, into the hole that you just flipped.</p>
                <p>Repeat this process for each Takoyaki ball.</p>
                <p>This process might take a little practice to be able to do it smoothly but don't worry, you will get there eventually.</p>
                <p><b>Please Note:</b> If you can't turn the takoyaki easily, it probably needs to cook for a bit longer. Let it cook longer and try again. This is often the mistake that most people make. Practice makes perfect!</p>
            </li>
            <li>You can usually only flip each ball about 2/3 of the way around, so allow it to cook a bit more before flipping again. The balls will become easier to turn the more they cook.</li>
            <li>Once all the balls start to look ,like actual balls, add a bit more oil outside of the holes onto the pan evenly to let it seep into each hole to make the outside of the balls a crunchy texture by lightly deep frying in the oil. Note: Don't put too much oil.</li>
            <li>Keep rotating them in the holes until they turn a golden brown color on all sides. Make sure they are cooked evenly.</li>
            <li>Congratulations! Now you successfully made the Takoyaki ball! Now move on to dress them.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Finish</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place Takoyaki on a plate and drizzle with Takoyaki sauce and Japanese Mayonnaise. Then sprinkle some Aonori and some Katsuobushi on top of them. They are gonna have the best look if you follow this order.</li>
            <li>Time to eat!</li>
        </ol>
