        <h3>Common known in English as Japanese octopus balls - is a quintessential Japanese street food that's found especially at summer festivals in Japan.</h3>
        <p>Takoyaki is a Japanese term for "octopus grilled/fried," and they are a very popular yatai(or mobile street food) snack. These lightly fried octopus balls have a crisp outer shell with a soft and moist center filled with pieces of octopus, pickled ginger, green onions, and crunchy tenkasu(or tempura pieces).</p>
        <p>These fried ocotpus balls were first popularized by a man named <i>Tomekichi Endo</i> from Osaka, Japan in the 1930's. Originally, they were filled with beef and konjac, they are far better known for their octopus filling these days. Endo was influenced by a Japanese dumpling called akashiyaki, which was made of egg batter and octopus.</p>
